Dry, KISS, Yagni Principle in c#

DRY= Don't repeat yourself<br />
KISS= Keep it simple, stupid<br />
YAGNI= You're not gonna need it<br />

<p>If you don't repeat yourself, keep it simple, and implement only the functionality you really truly need, 
your c# code will be cleaner, simpler, and much easier to maintain.</p>

<p> <strong>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle</strong>:
The DRY principle encourages developers to avoid duplication of code and promotes code reuse. It emphasizes that every piece of knowledge or logic should have a single, unambiguous representation within a system. By adhering to the DRY principle, you can reduce redundancy and improve maintainability, making it easier to update and change the code when necessary.</p>

<p><strong> KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) Principle:</strong>
The KISS principle suggests that simplicity should be preferred over complexity in software design. It advocates for straightforward and easy-to-understand solutions, avoiding unnecessary complexity that might make the code harder to read and maintain. Simpler code is generally more robust, easier to debug, and less prone to errors.</p>

<p><strong>YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) Principle:</strong>
The YAGNI principle advises developers not to implement functionality until it is actually needed. Avoiding speculative or premature additions to the codebase prevents unnecessary complexity and reduces the risk of introducing bugs. By focusing only on the requirements at hand, developers can deliver working solutions more efficiently.</p>
